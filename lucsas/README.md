# Lucsas portfolio
I created another portfolio to showcase my skills and jobs.

This one is just for my skills in ***PPC Management*** though.

I'll make some updates to polish everything and make it better with time. I need to study more things lol

(I don't consider my skills as a programmer really useful yet, there are many things to study yet)
